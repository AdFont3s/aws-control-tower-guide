# Component services<a name="aft-components"></a>

When you deploy AFT, components are added to your AWS environment from each of these AWS services\.
+ **[AWS Control Tower](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/what-is-control-tower.html)** – AFT uses AWS Control Tower Account Factory in the AWS Control Tower management account to provision accounts\.
+ **[Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html)** – AFT creates Amazon DynamoDB tables in the AFT management account, which store account requests, audit history of account updates, account metadata, and AWS Control Tower lifecycle events\. AFT also creates DynamoDB Lambda triggers to initiate downstream processes, such as starting the AFT account provisioning workflow\. 
+ **[Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html)** – AFT creates Amazon Simple Storage Service \(S3\) buckets in the AFT management account and the AWS Control Tower log archive account, which store logs generated by the AWS services that the AFT pipeline requires\. AFT also creates a Terraform backend S3 bucket, in primary and secondary AWS Regions, to store Terraform states generated during AFT pipeline workflows\.
+ **[Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html)** – AFT creates Amazon Simple Notification Service \(SNS\) topics in the AFT management account, which stores success and failure notifications after processing every AFT account request\. You may receive these messages using your choice of protocol\.
+ **[Amazon Simple Queuing Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/welcome.html)** – AFT creates an Amazon Simple Queuing Service \(Amazon SQS\) FIFO queue in the AFT management account\. The queue allows you to submit multiple account requests in parallel, but it sends one request at a time to AWS Control Tower Account Factory, for sequential processing\.
+ **[AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html)** – AFT creates AWS CodeBuild build projects in the AFT management account to initialize, compile, test, and apply Terraform plans for AFT source code in various build stages\.
+ **[AWS CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html)** – AFT creates AWS CodePipeline pipelines in the AFT management account to integrate with your selected, supported AWS CodeStar connections provider for AFT source code, and to trigger build jobs in AWS CodeBuild\.
+ **[AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)** – AFT creates AWS Lambda functions and layers in the AFT management account to perform steps during the account request, AFT account provisioning, and account customizations processes\.
+ **[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html)** – AFT sets up the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store in the AFT management account, to store the configuration parameters required for the AFT pipeline processes\.
+ **[Amazon CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)** – AFT creates Amazon CloudWatch log groups in the AFT management account to store logs generated by AWS services employed by the AFT pipeline\. The retention period for CloudWatch logs is set to `Never Expire`\.
+ **[Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html)** – AFT creates an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) to isolate services and resources in the AFT management account into a separate networking environment, for enhanced security\.
+ **[AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html)** – AFT uses the AWS Key Management Service \(KMS\) in the AFT management account and in the AWS Control Tower log archive account\. AFT creates keys to encrypt Terraform states, data stored in DynamoDB tables, and SNS topics\. These logs and artifacts are generated when AWS resources and services are deployed by AFT\. KMS keys created by AFT have yearly rotation enabled by default\.
+ **[AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)** – AFT follows the recommended Least Privilege model\. It creates AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) roles and policies in the AFT management account, in AWS Control Tower accounts, and in AFT provisioned accounts, as needed, to perform actions required during the AFT pipeline workflow\.
+ **[AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html)** – AFT creates AWS Step Functions state machines in the AFT management account\. These state machines orchestrate and automate the process and steps for the AFT account provisioning framework and customizations\.
+ **[Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html)** – AFT creates an Amazon EventBridge event bus in the AFT and AWS Control Tower management account to capture and store AWS Control Tower lifecycle events long\-term in the AFT management account's DynamoDB table\. AFT creates AWS CloudWatch event rules in the AFT management and AWS Control Tower management accounts, which trigger multiple steps required during running of the AFT pipeline workflow
+ **[AWS CloudTrail \(Optional\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)** – When this feature is enabled, AFT creates an AWS CloudTrail organization trail in the AWS Control Tower management account, for logging data events for Amazon S3 buckets and AWS Lambda functions\. AFT sends these logs to a central S3 bucket in the AWS Control Tower log archive account\.
+ **[AWS Support \(Optional\)](http://aws.amazon.com/https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/)** – When this feature is enabled, AFT turns on the AWS Enterprise Support plan for accounts provisioned by AFT\. By default, AWS accounts are created with the AWS Basic Support plan enabled\.
