# Create a new OU<a name="create-new-ou"></a>

**To create a new OU in AWS Control Tower**

1.  Navigate to the **OU list** page by selecting **Organizational units** on the left\.

1. Select **Add an OU** in the upper right\.

1. Specify a name in the **OU name** field\.

1.  In the **Parent OU** dropdown, you can see the hierarchy of registered OUs\. Select a parent OU for the new OU you’re creating\.

1. Choose **Add**\.

**Note**  
If your landing zone is not up to date, you will see a flat list instead of a hierarchy in the dropdown menu\. Even if your landing zone includes nested OUs, you will not see L5 OU’s in the dropdown, because you cannot create a new OU beneath a L5 OU\. For more information about nested OUs in AWS Control Tower, see [Nested OUs in AWS Control Tower](nested-ous.md)\.
