# Closing an Account Created in Account Factory<a name="delete-account"></a>

Accounts created in Account Factory are AWS accounts\. For information about closing AWS accounts, see [Closing an Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/close-account.html) in the *AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide*\.

**Note**  
 Closing an AWS account is not the same as unmanaging an account from AWS Control Towerâ€”these are separate actions\. You must unmanage the account before you close it\.
