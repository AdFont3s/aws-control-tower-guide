## Govern into selected Regions only<a name="region-select"></a>

**February 19, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

AWS Control Tower Region Selection provides you the ability to better manage the geographical footprint of your AWS Control Tower resources\. If you want to expand the number of Regions in which you host AWS resources or workloads for compliance, regulatory, cost, or other reasons, you can now select the specific additional Regions you want to govern into\. Note that you cannot opt out of Regions you are currently governing into\.

Region Selection is available when you set up a new landing zone or update your AWS Control Tower landing zone version\. When you use Account Factory to create a new account or enroll a preexisting member account or you use Extend Governance to enroll accounts in a preexisting organizational unit, AWS Control Tower deploys its governance capabilities of centralized logging, monitoring, and guardrails in your chosen Regions in the accounts\. For more information about selecting Regions, see [Deploying AWS Control Tower to a new AWS Region](configuration-updates.md#deploying-to-new-region)\.

## AWS Control Tower now extends governance to existing OUs in your AWS organizations<a name="extended-governance"></a>

**January 28, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

Extend governance to existing organizational units \(OUs\) \(those not in AWS Control Tower\) from within the AWS Control Tower console\. With this feature, you can bring top\-level OUs and included accounts under AWS Control Tower governance\. For information about extending governance to an entire OU, see [Register an existing organizational unit with AWS Control Tower](importing-existing.md)\.

When you register an OU, AWS Control Tower performs a series of checks to ensure successful extension of governance and enrollment of accounts within the OU\. For more information about common issues associated with the initial registration of an OU, see [Common causes of failure during registration or re\-registration](importing-existing.md#common-eg-failures)\.

## AWS Control Tower provides bulk account updates<a name="bulk-update"></a>

**January 28, 2021**

\(No update required for AWS Control Tower landing zone\)

With the bulk update feature, you can now update all accounts in a registered AWS Organizations organizational unit \(OU\) containing up to 300 accounts, with a single click, from the AWS Control Tower dashboard\. This is particularly useful in cases where you update your AWS Control Tower landing zone and must also update your enrolled accounts to align them to the current landing zone version\. 

This feature also helps you keep your accounts up to date when you update your AWS Control Tower landing zone to expand to new regions, or when you want to re\-register an OU to ensure that all accounts in that OU have the latest guardrails applied\. Bulk account update eliminates the need to update one account at a time or use an external script to perform the update on multiple accounts\.

For information about updating a landing zone, see [Update Your Landing Zone](configuration-updates.md#update-controltower)\.

For information about registering or re\-registering an OU, see [Register an existing organizational unit with AWS Control Tower](importing-existing.md)\.
