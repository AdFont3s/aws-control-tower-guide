# Resilience in AWS Control Tower<a name="disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones\. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low\-latency, high\-throughput, and highly redundant networking\. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption\. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures\.

AWS Control Tower is available in four AWS Regions \(US East \(N\. Virginia\), US East \(Ohio\), US West \(Oregon\), and EU \(Ireland\)\) with a home Region defined as the one your landing zone was set up within\.
