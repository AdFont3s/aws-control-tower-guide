# Terminology<a name="terminology"></a>

Here’s a quick review of some terms you'll see in the AWS Control Tower documentation\.

First, it's good to know that AWS Control Tower shares a lot of terminology with the AWS Organizations service, including the terms *organization* and *organizational unit \(OU\)*, which appear throughout this document\. 
+ For more information about organizations and OUs, see [AWS Organizations terminology and concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_getting-started_concepts.html)\. If you're new to AWS Control Tower, that terminology is a good place to begin\.
+  [AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html) is an AWS service that helps you centrally govern your environment as you grow and scale your workloads on AWS\. AWS Control Tower relies on AWS Organizations to create accounts, to enforce preventive guardrails at the OU level, and to provide centralized billing\.
+ An [AWS Account Factory account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/account-factory.html) is an AWS account provisioned using Account Factory in AWS Control Tower\. Sometimes, Account Factory is referred to informally as a “vending machine” for accounts\. 
+ Your AWS Control Tower [home Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/best-practices.html#tips-for-admin-setup) is the AWS Region in which your AWS Control Tower landing zone was deployed\. You can view your home Region in your landing zone settings\. 
+ [AWS Service Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/introduction.html) allows you to manage commonly deployed IT services, centrally\. In the context of this document, Account Factory uses AWS Service Catalog to provision new AWS accounts\. 
+ [AWS CloudFormation StackSets ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html) are a type of resource that extends the functionality of stacks so that you can create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and Regions with a single operation and a single CloudFormation template\. 
+ A  [stack instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html#stacksets-concepts-stackinstances) is a reference to a stack in a target account within a Region\. 
+ A [stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-whatis-concepts.html#w2ab1b5c15b) is a collection of AWS resources that you can manage as a single unit\. 
+ An [aggregator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/aggregate-data.html) is an AWS Config resource type that collects AWS Config configuration and compliance data from multiple accounts and Regions within the organization, allowing you to view and query this compliance data within a single account\. 
+ A [conformance pack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/conformance-packs.html) is a collection of AWS Config rules and remediation actions that can be deployed as a single entity in an account and a Region, or across an organization in AWS Organizations\. You can use a conformance pack to help customize your AWS Control Tower environment\. For technical blogs that provide more details, see [Related information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/related-information.html#working-existing-organizations)\.
+ To baseline an account is to set up its blueprints and guardrails\. The baselining process also sets up the centralized logging and security audit roles on the account, as part of deploying the blueprints\. AWS Control Tower baselines are contained in the roles that you apply to every enrolled account\.
